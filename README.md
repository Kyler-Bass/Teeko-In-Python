## How To Use Teeko:
**1.** Teeko is a two-player game, and only pass and play is available in my version.
**2.** The two different players are represented by colors: black and red. Black is the first player to play
**3.** At the start, each player will take turns placing a piece onto the board (5x5) until each player has 4 pieces on the board
**4.** When each player has 4 pieces on the board, players will then take their turns: where they will move one of their pieces to an adjacent circle with no piece on it.
**5.** The game will end when one player's pieces are in any of the following configurations:
- 4 in a row
- 4 in a column
- 4 along a diagonal
- 4 in a square

**6.** When a player wins, depending on their color a custom winning animation will play until you exit the game
