# Teeko-In-Python
This is the board game Teeko made with Pygame and Python. It is pass and play two player, and had instructions in the game on how to play it. I wrote all of the code and created all of the images, taking inspiration from the wikipedia board image for mine. 
I will make a couple updates cleaning up the code and adding new stuff but it is mostly complete.
Run main.py to play the game.
